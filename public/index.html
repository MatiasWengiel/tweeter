      <p>It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Even though the sound of it
        Is something quite atrocious
        If you say it loud enough
        You'll always sound precocious
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Because I was afraid to speak
        When I was just a lad
        Me father gave me nose a tweak
        And told me I was bad
        But then one day I learned a word
        That saved me aching nose
        The biggest word you ever heard
        And this is how it goes
        Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Even though the sound of it
        Is something quite atrocious
        If you say it loud enough
        You'll always sound precocious
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        He traveled all around the world and everywhere he went
        He'd use his word and all would say there goes a clever gent
        When dukes of Maharajah pass the time of day with me
        I say me special word and then they ask me out to tea (woo)
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Even though the sound of it
        Is something quite atrocious
        If you say it loud enough
        You'll always sound precocious
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
        Now you can say it backwards which is
        Dociousaliexpisticfragicalirupus
        But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?
        Indubitably
        So when the cat has got your tongue
        There's no need for dismay (oui, oui)
        Just summon up this word
        And then you've got a lot to say
        But better use it carefully
        Or it can change your life
        For example
        Yes?
        One night I said it to me girl and now me girl's me wife
        Oh, and a lovely thing she is, too, ha ha ha
        She's
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
        Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
